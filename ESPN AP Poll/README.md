# ESPN AP Poll Week 6 Scraper

Scraper for ESPN's AP Top 25 Poll - Men's College Basketball (Week 6, December 2025)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT RE-RUN THIS SCRAPER

The `ap_poll_week6.csv` file is a **STATIC SNAPSHOT** from Week 6 (December 8, 2025). 

**DO NOT** run `scrape_ap_poll.py` to update this file - it will overwrite the Week 6 data with the current week's poll, which breaks the National Champion Checklist feature that specifically checks Week 6 AP Poll rankings.
